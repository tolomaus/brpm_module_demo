This repository represents an module for a fictive customer "Demo", to be used on top of the [BRPM content framework](https://github.com/BMC-RLM/brpm_content_framework). It contains customer-specific logic to integrate BRPM and JIRA in both directions: creating BRPM tickets from created or updated JIRA issues and udating the state of JIRA issues after a request was deployed into an environment.
